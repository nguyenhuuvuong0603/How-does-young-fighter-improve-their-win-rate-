“Competition experience is one of the factors that greatly affect the win rate of UFC fighters. So what does experience bring and what do young inexperienced fighters need to do to improve their win rate? That's my goal in this project.”

The main steps in the project:	

●	Data cleaning on more than 700000 data points.

●	Using Numpy, Pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

●	Conclusion: fighters with little experience with a low win rate nên focus on Ground skills to improve their win rate.
